This application, in a broader picture, is a work of integration of backend and frontend

curated using NodeJS, MongoDB, ExpressJS and ReactJS. It provides the user with

numerous necessities with privacy and security.

It uses JWT authentication saving the token in local memory rather than cookie for enhanced

security and MVC architecture to provide an impeccable experience with a simple yet

beholding UI/UX.
